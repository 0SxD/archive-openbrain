# Session 22 Handoff — 2026-03-25
> Created by Claude (Opus) orchestrator. Pick up from here next session.

## What Happened This Session

1. **Audited Gemini's massive research file** (`research/multitopic_OpenBrainLM_Research_3.25.2026_Agent Memory Audit.md`)
   - Covers: zero-context reviewers, adversarial debate, airlock pattern, git worktrees, blackboard architecture, semgrep/CI, naming standards, skill crystallization, knowledge crystallization, parallelism management
   - Creator's annotations: NO SHA hashing (Security Theater), just pass/fail gates with human confirmation

2. **Gap analysis completed** — current state vs research requirements:
   - 2 IMPLEMENTED: standing orders, minimum viable context
   - 5 PARTIAL: zero-context reviewer, airlock, episodic agents, schema compaction, quality gates
   - 3 MISSING: pre-commit hooks + semgrep, git worktree isolation, blackboard architecture

3. **Gemini CLI research verified** (session 21 — already in short_term.md)
   - Official repo: github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
   - GEMINI.md = parallel to CLAUDE.md, `@import` syntax for shared memory
   - Native MCP support, custom subagents via `.gemini/agents/*.md`

4. **Gemini AntiGravity defined the coordination architecture** (Creator pasted Gemini's design):
   - `agent_sync/` directory = the blackboard (fills the MISSING gap)
   - Claude writes audit requests → Gemini reads in IDE → Gemini runs semgrep → writes results → Claude reads
   - Stage 1: local semgrep via Gemini before commit
   - Stage 2: GitHub Actions + CodeRabbit on PRs
   - SARIF files linked to commit SHA = audit trail
   - Gemini has internal `task.md` checklist system

5. **AutoDream / Memory 2.0 discovered** — needs research + integration design

## NEXT SESSION — Priority Actions

### P0: Research AutoDream / Memory 2.0
**WHY:** Could fundamentally change how memory architecture works. Must understand before building more on current pattern.

- [ ] Update Claude Code: `npm update -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- [ ] Research AutoDream: what exactly does it do? How does it interact with existing memory files?
- [ ] Research `autoMemoryDirectory` setting — can we point it at our existing `memory/` dirs?
- [ ] Research agent-scoped memory frontmatter (`memory` field with user/project/local scope)
- [ ] Research memory timestamps — how do they work with our existing schema?
- [ ] **KEY QUESTION:** Does AutoDream conflict with or complement Trinity Consolidation?
- [ ] **KEY QUESTION:** Should we let AutoDream handle what short_term→long_term consolidation does now?
- [ ] Design integration: AutoDream + existing 4-layer memory architecture

### P1: Wire Gemini AntiGravity
**WHY:** Creator wants multi-agent working so he can use Gemini effectively.

- [ ] Create `<WORKSPACE>\OpenBrainLM\agent_sync\` directory
- [ ] Write `<WORKSPACE>\OpenBrainLM\.gemini\GEMINI.md` — import shared memory files via `@` syntax
- [ ] Write `.gemini/settings.json` — MCP servers (NotebookLM, etc.)
- [ ] Write `.gemini/agents/` — custom audit agents if needed
- [ ] Create agent_sync protocol doc (request/result file naming, fields, status tracking)
- [ ] Test: Claude writes audit_request → Gemini reads it → Gemini writes audit_result → Claude reads

### P2: Fix MISSING Gaps (deploy in parallel via Sonnet agents)
**WHY:** Research says these are needed for reliable multi-agent operation.

- [ ] **Pre-commit hook + semgrep:** Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit` that runs `semgrep check` on staged files. Hard fail if high-severity.
- [ ] **Git worktree isolation:** Document worktree pattern in a skill. Wire `EnterWorktree`/`ExitWorktree` tools into agent dispatch workflow.
- [ ] **Blackboard architecture:** `agent_sync/` directory (from Gemini's design) IS the blackboard. Define the file contract (JSON or MD, required fields, status flags).

### P3: Fix PARTIAL Gaps
- [ ] **Quarantine directory:** Create `research/_quarantine/` on disk. Update research protocol rule to use it.
- [ ] **Schema compaction verification:** Run todo #2 — test that long_term.md entries have all 4 fields.
- [ ] **Zero-context reviewer enforcement:** Add explicit "DO NOT include any context from the authoring agent" to audit dispatch template in rule 06.

## Files to Read First (Next Session Bootup)

1. `<WORKSPACE>\OpenBrainLM\memory\short_term.md` — sessions 20-22 (current state)
2. `<WORKSPACE>\OpenBrainLM\research\multitopic_OpenBrainLM_Research_3.25.2026_Agent Memory Audit.md` — the big research file
3. `<WORKSPACE>\OpenBrainLM\research\handoff_session22_2026-03-25.md` — THIS FILE
4. `<WORKSPACE>\OpenBrainLM\memory\notebooklm_brain.md` — NotebookLM state + what's broken

## Key Creator Directives (This Session)

1. "fix everything" — close all gaps identified in research
2. "send multiple sub sonnet agents" — use parallel Sonnet agents once we know what to do
3. "research what to do, don't just decide you know" — official sources only for AntiGravity/AutoDream
4. "create a handoff" — THIS document
5. "design system to work with claude code" — AutoDream integration is the priority
6. NO SHA hashing, no crypto tags — just pass/fail gates
7. "AntiGravity" = Gemini CLI IDE (Creator's name for it)

## Open Research Questions

1. What exactly is AutoDream? Is it shipped or preview? What Claude Code version?
2. Does `autoMemoryDirectory` accept absolute paths to existing dirs?
3. Can agent-scoped memory (`memory` frontmatter) replace our manual memory dispatch?
4. How does AutoDream's pruning interact with our append-only memory rule?
5. Should Trinity Consolidation become an AutoDream extension or stay separate?
6. Is there an official Anthropic blog post or changelog entry for AutoDream?
